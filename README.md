# Browser Fingerprinting Demo

A single-page educational project that demonstrates what information JavaScript can collect from users who simply click a link. This project reveals the extensive data websites can gather for tracking, analytics, or access control purposes.

## What This Project Does

When a user visits this page, it automatically collects comprehensive browser and device information using only client-side JavaScript. This demonstrates that:

- **Any website can collect this data** without special permissions
- **99% of web users** are vulnerable since JavaScript is enabled by default
- **Even Tor users** are exposed if JavaScript isn't disabled
- **Website owners receive this data** on their servers from every visitor

## Information Collected

### Browser & System Information
- User Agent string
- Platform and operating system
- Hardware capabilities (CPU cores, memory)
- Java status
- Do Not Track preference

### Screen & Display
- Screen resolution and available space
- Color depth and pixel depth
- Window dimensions
- Device pixel ratio

### Localization
- Preferred language
- All supported languages
- Timezone
- Local time

### Network & Location
- IP address
- Approximate geolocation (city, region, country)
- ISP information
- Coordinates

*Note: IP-based geolocation requires an API token from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)*

## The 6-Hash Tracking System

Instead of creating a single fingerprint hash (which changes when users modify any setting), this project generates **six independent hashes** for more robust tracking:

1. **Browser Fingerprint** - User agent, platform
2. **Device Fingerprint** - Hardware specs, screen properties and pixel ratios
3. **Languages Fingerprint** - Language preferences
4. **Window Fingerprint** - Browser window dimensions
5. **Timezone Fingerprint** - Timezone and local time patterns
6. **IP Fingerprint** - IP address and location data

## The log system

Every request sent to the server is saved in `server.log` with timestamp, client hashes, unique `userID` number and `networkID` number based on the client hash info.

### Why Multiple Hashes?

If a user tries to evade tracking by:
- Using a VPN (changes IP) → Other 5 hashes remain the same
- Changing user agent → Other 5 hashes remain the same
- Resizing the browser window → Other 5 hashes remain the same

This multi-hash approach allows websites to still identify users even when they attempt to mask their identity by changing individual attributes.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Professor606/web-fingerprinting.git
cd web-fingerprinting
touch .env
```

2. Get an API token from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/signup)

3. Define your API token in the `.env` file:
```bash
IPINFO_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

4. Specify the desired server port in the .env file:
```bash
PORT=3000
```

5. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

6. Start the server
```bash
npm run start
```

## Defense Against Tracking

To minimize fingerprinting:
- Use privacy-focused browsers (Tor Browser with JavaScript disabled, Brave)
- Enable fingerprinting protection in browser settings
- Use browser extensions that spoof fingerprints
- Disable JavaScript on sensitive sites
- Use multiple browser profiles for different activities

## Use Cases (Educational)

Understanding browser fingerprinting is important for:
- **Security professionals** testing website vulnerabilities
- **Privacy researchers** studying tracking techniques
- **Web developers** implementing ethical analytics
- **Users** learning about their digital footprint
